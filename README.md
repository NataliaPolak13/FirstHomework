## Description of ExtraCalculator

ExtraCalculator is a project featuring calculator written in C#. The calculator meets basic mathematical requirements such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, and includes variables. The project implements conditional statements, loops, methods, and is secured against arithmetic operations or incorrect input.

## Features

- **Basic Operations:** Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation.
- **Factorial Calculation:** Calculates the factorial for both input numbers.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Utilizes a console-based interface for user interaction.
- **Security Measures:** Incorporates checks to prevent errors from invalid input, such as division by zero.
- **Infinite Loop:** Allows continuous operation until the user decides to exit.

  
## Usage

1. Run the application, and it will prompt you to enter two numbers.
2. Choose from the available operations by entering the corresponding number.
3. View the calculated result and decide what you would like to do.


## Description of FirstHomework

The FirstHomework directory contains an enhanced version of the previous project, allowing users to input mathematical expressions through the keyboard. The calculator supports basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation. It also includes the ability to calculate factorials. The program features a simple console-based user interface and is designed to handle various scenarios, including security measures to prevent errors from invalid input.

## Features

- **Enhanced Input:** Allows users to input mathematical expressions (e.g., "1 + 2") through the keyboard. It supports input with '--' (e.g., "1 -- 2").
- **Basic Operations:** Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation.
- **Factorial Calculation:** Calculates the factorial for the input number.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Utilizes a console-based interface for user interaction.
- **Security Measures:** Incorporates checks to prevent errors from invalid input, such as division by zero.
- **Infinite Loop:** Allows continuous operation until the user decides to exit.

## Usage

1. Run the application, and it will prompt you to enter a mathematical expression.
2. Choose from the available operations by entering the corresponding numbers.
3. View the calculated result and decide what you would like to do.
   
**Note:** ExtraCalculator and FirstHomework accept only two numbers at a time.
